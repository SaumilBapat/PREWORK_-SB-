My biggest challenges will be:

3. Put in the Hard Hours (At Least 20 Hours!) ...
I haven't historically been very consistent in my work habits. I tend to put things off and then pull a few all nighters. This has caused issues in the past and something I'm determined to fix at this time. Consistently putting in 20 hours a week may not come naturally to me but will definitely be a great habit to develop.

6. Crumple the Paper Tiger...
I've tended to focus more on consuming material (reading lectures, listening to podcasts etc.) as opposed to actually doing exercises. This'll also need to change.

7. Find a Squad...
I tend to work through things alone, but experience has shown me that working with people is a much better way to get things done. Often you get ideas you would never have though of otherwise, or your teammates can help point out easy wins in your workflow. I'll be consciously more social in my approach here.
